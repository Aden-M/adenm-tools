This excel workbook aims to provide the user with an approximation of the gradient of a two-dimensional scalar function.
The first sheet represents the values of the base function f(x,y), the dx and dy represent the difference in position between the collected values of the base function. 
Please note that if these are not constant for each direction, the tool will not produce correct results.
The second sheet represents the x components of the gradient of the function f(x,y)
The third sheet represnts the y components of the gradient of the function f(x,y)
Such that if you were to combine sheet 2 and sheet 3, then you would have <df/dx, df/dy>
This tool is created for the Texas A&M Visualization Studio machines and therefore presumes
 that the direction of x is defined as increasing from up-to-down and that the direction of y is increasing defined left-to-right.
 Do observe that the qualititative up-to-down and left-to-right represent the direction of the spreadsheet.
 E.g. up-to-down would be from row 1 to row 2 and left-to-right would be from column A to column B.
Please note that the tool is not guaranteed to be correct, and that the user should double-check their answers.
Additionally, if this tool is used for academic work, proper authorization should be sought to ensure that the use of this tool does not constitute academic dishonesty.

Texas A&M Students, please note:
Per Honor Code 20.1.2.3.1 Cheating, Subsection 4:
Collaborating with other students in the completion of assigned work, unless specifically authorized by the instructor teaching the course. It is safe to assume that all assignments are to be completed individually unless the instructor indicates otherwise; however, students who are unsure should seek clarification from their instructors.
